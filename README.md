### Hi there 👋

I'm a web developer and graphic designer currently residing in the Pacific Northwest (U.S.) with a passion for all things design + code.

I also enjoy spending time with family, working with audio and video, and working on home improvement projects.

When I'm not working, I'm playing on the computer and hanging out with my kids! Check out our YouTube channels: [Sleepy Slawths](https://www.youtube.com/@sleepyslawths) and [Mikey &amp; Daddy](https://www.youtube.com/@mikeyndaddy)

- 💻 My favorite programming languages are PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript.
- ⚙️ My favorite libraries and frameworks are React and Next.js.
- 📑 WordPress is my favorite CMS and open-source project.
- 🌱 As I learn and grow, my favorites evolve!

I've been a professional web developer since 2012. I'm looking to learn more about collaborative development by contributing to open source projects.
