### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer with a design background and over 12 years of professional working experience. I currently reside in the Pacific Northwest (U.S.).

- 💻 My favorite programming languages are PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript.
- ⚙️ My favorite libraries and frameworks are React and Next.js.
- 📑 I've worked extensively with WordPress.
- 🌱 As I learn and grow, my favorites evolve!

I've been a professional web developer since 2012. I'm looking to learn more about collaborative development by contributing to open source projects. Sometimes I share my thoughts on my [personal & tech blog](https://www.missionmike.dev/).
